# spam-detection

This project is a very helpful one for those who want to classify text and use the "nltk" library.
It was a project by Rajtilak Pal (aka CampusX) and helped me a lot doing the analysis and prediction.

The data consists of categories for Spam/ Not spam and the texts we need to classify.
